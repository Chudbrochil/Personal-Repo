Amazon Leadership Principles

TODO: Go over these and come up with answers to potential questions.

Customer Obsession
Consider and care about the customer. "Maximizing profit" mustn't get in the
way of giving a good customer experience.

Ownership
Own a problem. Don't throw it over the wall to another group.

Invent and Simplify
Think outside of the box. Look for ways to optimize and innovate.
If a meeting isn't useful, cancel it.

Are Right, A Lot
Every perspective and opinion needs to be valued. Just because someone is
junior doesn't mean they're wrong.

Learn and Be Curious
Be willing to learn new things and adapt. Don't be married to a language.

Hire and Develop the Best
Recognize top talent and focus on them. Help grow those that are willing to
learn and work hard.

Insist on the Highest Standards
Care about fixing the root cause of an issue. Not just getting it accepted
by the team.

Think Big
Go big about your ideas. Consider wild alternatives when thinking about a
solution to a problem.

Bias for Action
Making a decision now is better than making no decision. Be agile. Fail fast.

Frugality
Think of ways to do more with less. Perhaps 2 engineers can complete a project,
instead of 5.

Earn Trust
Be self-critical. Own your mistakes and grow from them.

Dive Deep
Be willing to get deep into an issue. Fix the true root cause.

Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Be willing to fight authority. Engage in "data-based" disagreements. In other
words, present a prototype to prove a capability.

Deliver Results
The deadline is important. If some things need to be cut, so be it.
It must ship.
