Ch1. Arrays and Strings

When adding strings together, use a StringBuffer. (Think StringBuilder, but for adding strings not chars).
This avoid having to create new immutable strings everytime.

Remember: A hash collision creates a linked list at that hash.

Q1:
If we are given ASCII characters, we can just make an array of size 256
instead of using a hashmap.
Ask whether or not chars are ascii or unicode...

Q2:
Iterative string reversal is easy.
Practice recursive string reversal again.
