All my code is correct in the submission, but I was previously using Word as my editor.  Sorry, I will now use Notepad or the included SQL text editor.

On the “AND” statement there is only one result given because it is a combination of where the code
is greater than 200 and the description is Tropical or Carnival. On the “OR” statement there is 6
results because it is listing where the code is greater than 200 AND where the description is Tropical
or Carnival.
One is OR, one is AND.
