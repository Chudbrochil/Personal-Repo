TODO Comments:

AudioManager
1. Fix bug where music is affected by the sound effects slider

InventoryManager
1. Inventory manager can be revised heavily, the usage of getitemlist is somewhat unnecessary and can all
be transitioned to using the dictionary.

PlayerManager
1. Health can be utilized within the game and easily be made into a GUI display on screen and a game mechanic

FPSController
1. FPSController and RelativeMovement can be modularized to have jump, speed and other movement criteria
separated from the actual movement

GameEvent
1. This is a robust system that can be utilized to send a lot more messages throughout the classes

PopupController
1. This class can be separated significantly into various modular OOP classes
2. dropItem and useItem are a bit gimmicky and could be their own classes that interface with the
inventory system better
3. Bug where shiftPerspective will sometimes not operate as expected
4. Disable crosshair upon entering third-person mode

RayShooter
1. Implement game mechanic into the character stopping in place. Perhaps start dialog/steal bones, etc.

WanderingAI
1. AI could be improved, make it more intelligent and less random in it's pathing.
2. Adding an IEnumerator to make the AI wait .1-.5s before rotating would be quality of life improvement.
