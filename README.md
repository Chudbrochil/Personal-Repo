I have made efforts to hide "sensitive code": specifically CS357(UNM), Google FooBar, Project Euler, and my currently enrolled classes. This code is available by request if you ask to be a collaborator on the private version of this repo. Additionally, if you see code you prefer not to be shared here, feel free to contact me at WGalczak [at] gmail [dot] com

Hello, my name is Anthony Galczak. I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of New Mexico graduating in Spring 2019. I have worked as an intern at Sandia National Labs since September 2015. I was previously an IT consultant for Mintz Infotech as well as technical support at T-Mobile and Charter Communications.

Spring 2019 UNM Schedule:

CS 375 - Introduction to Numerical Computing

CS 460 - Software Engineering

MATH 312 - Partial Differential Equations

MATH 313 - Complex Variables

MATH 317 - Elementary Combinatorics

## CNM ##
This directory corresponds to the classes I took at Central New Mexico College where I obtained an AAS in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Computer Programming. I also acquired a multitude of other degrees and certificates at CNM, but the CIS degree is most relevant to my career and git repo. I formally graduated from CNM in Fall 2016 with honors (3.9 GPA).

Relevant classes taken:

CIS 1250 - Python Programming

CIS 1513 - DB Design/SQL I

CIS 1680 - Linux Essentials

CIS 1275 - C++ Programming I

CIS 2520 - Intro to SQL / SQL II

CIS 1280 - .NET / C# I

CIS 2275 - C++ Programming II

CIS 2521 - Database Programming With PL/SQL

	- Learned PL/SQL
        
CIS 2096 - Computer Game and Simulation Development

	- Used Unity and cutting-edge technologies like Oculus and HoloLens
        
CIS 2235 - Java Programming I

CIS 2237 - Android App Development with Java

	- Made multiple Android apps, including latest Android 6 features.
        
CIS 2284 - .NET / C# II

	- Used MVC and ASP.NET. Made multiple websites using C#/HTML/Javascript
        

I also took math upto Calculus III at CNM.


## UNM ##
This directory corresponds to the classes I took at University of New Mexico where I am still attending. I started UNM in Fall of 2016 major'ing in Computer Science. I then found myself drawn towards Mathematics and decided to double major in Math as of Fall 2017. I am planned to graduate UNM with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics in Spring 2019. As of Fall 2017 I have been accepted into the "Shared Credit Program" that allows me to take Graduate level electives while continuing my undergraduate degree. I will be taking my first graduate courses this Spring 2018. I plan to complete my MS in Spring 2020. My current GPA is 4.10.

Relevant classes taken:

CS 152L - Computer Programming Fundamentals (Java)

CS 241L - Data Organization (C)

CS 251L - Intermediate Programming (Java)

CS 261 - Mathematical Foundations of CS (Discrete Math)

CS 293 - Social and Ethical Issues in CS

## MISC ##
I competed with a group I led at the "RSI Hack-A-Thon" in November 2016 where we got 2nd place. We collected $400 prize money for this project. This Android app is in this folder as well other miscellaneous projects that aren't big enough to warrant their own repo.
