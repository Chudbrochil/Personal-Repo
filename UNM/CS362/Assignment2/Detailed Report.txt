I limited myself to 5 foods found on:
https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/data/AverageRetailFoodAndEnergyPrices_USandMidwest_Table.htm
Otherwise, I might end up down quite the rabbit hole of the millions of foods on www.myfitnesspal.com.

The February 2018 pricing information found on the bls link above is where I sourced all my prices.

I initially picked broccoli, eggs, chicken, rice, bananas. Inspired by some version of a "bodybuilder" diet.

I gathered my nutrition information from www.nutritiondata.self.com.
