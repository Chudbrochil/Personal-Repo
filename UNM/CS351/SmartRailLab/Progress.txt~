Anthony:
Make a train out of some objects in a canvas
Make the train move left to right
Make train tracks, find some elements online?


Anna:
Look into multi-threading and how to use it?
	Notes from Anthony:
	- Look into new Thread(Runnable()), JavaFX multi-threading is different than "Java" multi-threading
	- Use JavaFX multi-threading
	- Atomic data types
	- Thread Pools?



Classes to implement:

*Suggestion: Implement an action listener for each event. Each of those is a thread anyhow--the action listeners can hold the objects that contain data for the track components and use them and send messages to the other listeners. (This puts the communication between threads in terms that I understand.) A thread reserves a route, keeps track of the route, and after the train passes over each component, the thread 'frees' the route.

Should each of these implement a 'drawable' interface that returns something with the object stored in it that the gui can then arrage? Or, drawing on canvas--maybe each object knows where it is, or parameters are passed as to where on the canvas the object should be drawn, and it draws itself. (Important for trains to keep updating and for routes to be 'reserved' visually.) 

Train 
	- This is a big class, might even need some children or even helper classes
	- Each train needs to be a thread
	- Train sends messages

TrackSegment
	- method for securing a route
	- aware of trains on it
	- references to left and right neighbors
	- variable for which train is currently on it (null if no train)
	- reserved/free boolean (A little harder than the others. Should there be a boolean that says which way the train that reserved the track is coming from? Do we need that?)

Switch
	- references to three neighbors
	- knowledge of whether it is a left or right switch
	- closed or open state
	- Does the train teleport over switches?
	- reserved/free boolean

Light
	- references to two neighbors
	- always 'on'; green in one direction, red in another. 
	- reserved/free boolean
	- 

Station
	- reference to one neighbor
	- name of station. Has ability to answer the question 'are you X station?' from train's request.
