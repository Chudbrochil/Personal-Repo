Anthony:
Make a train out of some objects in a canvas
Make the train move left to right
Make train tracks, find some elements online?


Anna:
Look into multi-threading and how to use it?
	Notes from Anthony:
	- Look into new Thread(Runnable()), JavaFX multi-threading is different than "Java" multi-threading
	- Use JavaFX multi-threading
	- Atomic data types
	- Thread Pools?
