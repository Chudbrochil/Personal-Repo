// This is a sample of bad input to the program. I do a decent amount of checks to make sure that we don't make
// a bogus track, but if you request ridiculous things to be created/drawn, then it will generally make ridiculous things.
// Additionally, any number that is not 1-6 will be defaulted to a 1 which is just a regular track.
