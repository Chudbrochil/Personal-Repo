Project 3: SmartRail

This project was assigned from CS 351 and due Nov. 16, 2017.
The goal was to created a multi-threaded train simulation using
Java and JavaFX.

How to Play:

First, click MakeTrain button to make a train in the trainyard.
Click your created train and click a station to put it in the station.
Click the trains' destination station.
Assuming you picked a valid destination:
    Lights and switches will be reserved on the way to the destination
    Your train will travel to the destination unreserving components
        along the way



Known Bugs:



List of Extra Features:
Sounds for station arrival and train "GO".
Ability to create LOTS(30 is current max..., could even go higher) of trains
Ability to click on the trains and move them into stations dynamically




Possible Future Features and Optimizations:

Dragging and dropping trains into stations.
    - This wouldn't be difficult to do, however bugs and requirements add up 
        quick so it isn't added in this time.
