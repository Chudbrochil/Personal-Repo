NOT-OPTIONAL:
Anthony: (STATION PASS-THROUGH FIX)Trains moving over switches end up passing stations (Might get fixed by proper unreserve route....)
Anna: (SWITCH RESERVE FIX)Switches don't properly reserve themselves. It seems like reserved is always false...
Anna: (UNRESERVE MSG)send unreserve route when train is leaving a component (new message)
Anna: (LIGHTS)Verify that switch lights are working correctly
Anna: (MULTI-TRAIN)If I set a train down on the same track and let it go, it won't wait for the track to be reserved before going?
Anthony: Per the spec, "Two trains cannot be on the same track". I don't do a check for this, not sure how. (Reserve route checks?)
Us: Documentation all over the code

Optional:
Anthony: Bugs with trainyard display
Anthony: More options for the textfield output
Anna: send no route to station message when train is requesting a station
Anthony: Remove the trains when they arrive at the station?
Anna: Need some sort of hook that lets me know if there is no route to the station
