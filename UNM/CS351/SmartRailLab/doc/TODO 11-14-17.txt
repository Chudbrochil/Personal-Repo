TO-DOs 11-14-17:

**Must-Do's before submission**
(Anna): Document why Messaging is thread-safe (Anthony: This may already be done, I'm unsure)
(Anthony): Talk to Joel about the verification of config files, our implementation doesn't really need 
            verification given how the files are setup.
            
            If invalid file,
            
            
(US): Look at all the TO-DOs in code. Most of these are comments.

Preferred before submission:
(Anna): Station Message methods broke up just like RailTrack/RailSwitch/Train
(Anna): Make train drawing more smooth on switches
(US): Look at the commits, and find dirty ones that don't compile.

Optional:
(Anthony): Canvas auto-sizing
(Anthony): More options for the textfield output (simstatus and useralert)
(Anna): send no route to station message when train is requesting a station (Includes hook for no route to display to user)
