phase 1 string:
I used "x /25c 0x4026f0" to get this...

The future will be better tomorrow.

Safety break points
break *0x40174a
break *0x40174e
break *0x401767

Phase 2:
break *0x400f49

first number is 1 via the cmpl $0x1,(%rsp) on 0x400f67
rax is 2, second number is 2
We are in a loop, we popped back upto *0x400f7a
comparing value at *0x400f8c again, %rax is 4, third number is 4

Had to restart gdb as my initial 1 2 3 4 5 6 didn't work...
Based on 1 2 4, I'm guessing it is 1 2 4 8 16 32

This is indeed correct, passed through to phase 3...


Phase 3:
break *0x400fad

3 inputs expected

happened upon 1 as the first number,

looking for the 2nd...

%rax at 0x401021 is 0x41 or 4*16 + 1 = 65

enter 65 as 2nd digit later...

go until *0x40101c

this soon jumps to *0x4010f2 which does a cmp to %al

this value is 0x76..., which is 7*16 + 6 = 118

Turns out it is looking for it in character form, 118 in ASCII is v

So we need to enter 1 v 65

Phase 4:
break *0x40114a

1st run of phase_4:

First part I found to block me up was 0x401170 which is a "cmp $0x2,%eax" which has a corresponding
jne after it that leads to explode_bomb. My %rax was 1, I did "set $rax = 2" just to get past this
to see more logic in the assembly... I will investigate this difference later.

2 lines down is 0x401175 which does "cmpl $0xe,(%rsp)". I know 0xe is 14 comparing to what is in
%rsp, again with a nasty jump after this line.
%rsp apparently is my input value, which I entered a 1. This won't be equal to the 14.
Again, setting a register (%rsp) to 14 to continue to investigate...

gdb/bomb didn't like this. I seg fault'ed.

Just for fun when I enter a value for phase_4, I'm going to use 14... (0xE)

Alright, 2nd run of phase_4:
immediately I'm going to run "until *0x401170" to find out what's going on there.

Looks like the 'ole %rax is still at 0x1. Setting this to 2 to continue again and I will do
something different at the next compare (or my value is right?)

Now, at 0x401175, a "x/d $rsp" outputs 14...
Let's try to keep stepping after the compare...

Okay, success. the "jbe 401180" at 0x401179 jumped over the explode_bomb and now I'm at 0x401180.

I step until the func4 call. I'm going to immediately exit this as I don't care what it does for now.
I want to see if I can "hack" the registers to get past the bomb at the end or see what output it is
expecting from the function first.

We come out of the function at 0x401192 which is "cmp $0x2b, %eax".
We want our return value of the function to be 0x2b, which is 2*16 + 11 = 43.
Upon checking %rax, it is 45... Strange, it is very close to the right answer.

Let's set $rax to 43 and see where this goes...
My luck ran out, it jumped to explode_bomb at 0x40119e.
Upon further analysis, I'm realizing that that is a "jne", so it means jump if not equal.
I shouldn't have set $rax to be 43, whoops.

Time to start over again...

3rd run of phase_4:
I'm going to experiment with entering "24" as my value. Maybe the first number is the input to 
that first $rax that I'm jumping over by setting it's value manually.

until *0x401170 again...

%rax is still 1..., Let's investigate the line before the sscanf call 0x401166 "mov $0x402a59, %esi"
That 0x402a59 address looks interesting/promising...

4th run:
Input: 14

Got down to the address, couldn't read it. Looked at the register that took it's value and the value
of the register is 622879781... Hrm. Doesn't seem promising. It's just the pointer to 0x402a59 given by
"p/x $rsi" instead of "x/d $rsi"
As an aside, I see this address being referenced in phase_5... looks like compiled address/library.
Could be part of sscanf.

I'm beginning to think this is a count of the length of the string being inputted or something along
those lines...

Anyways, back to the bottom half of phase_4...
I looked at "info reg" inside func 4. I noticed that a ton of registers are set to my magic num 14.
Did this function loop over my number? i.e. i = 14...
Anyways, I didn't look at anything else in the function.

I stepped right into explode_bomb, sigh.

5th run:
Let's experiment a bit with the input. See if I can get the first rax to change off the sscanf.
Perhaps this is a function that takes more than 1 argument and this is an argument checker.

Input: 2 14  (Inspired by 2 being expected value and the 14 getting us somewhere in bottom half)

until *0x401170 again, sweet! rax is now 0x2. No more hacks of setting it.

Going to be a bit careful with my stepi's now.
Did stepi until 0x401175 where we do cmp $0xe,(%rsp). This _should_ be the comparison of my number
to 14. Let's check.
x/d $rsp gives 2. Damn. My first argument should be 14.

Kept stepping just to experiment and indeed, I hit the bomb.

6th run:
Input: 14 2

Alright, so now after getting to the compare we know that 0x40114a through 0x401173 is just making
sure we are passing 2 inputs (arguments).

stepi'ed to 0x401180.

If i do some analysis on these following lines before the function I can easily tell these are arguments
being passed in.
mov $0xe,%edx is first arg 14
mov $0x0,%esi is second arg 0
mov (%rsp),%edi is third arg which is my passed in arg of 14

Alright, guess it's time to look inside func4.
I know there is a loop so I'm going to skip ahead a bit.

Let's move to the first jump. 0x40112a
%rax is 7...

Continuing to step until I see 0x401148 which does not execute and we go further down to a recursive call
at 0x401141

first layer of recursion I see (I skipped a bunch of stuff however...)
first jump
%rax is 3...
second jump
%rax is 11...

2nd layer
%rax is 1
%rax is 13

I skipped ahead to the end of the recursive pops at 0x401146
27->38->45 is the pattern I saw.

Now we are back into phase_4:

Going until the "cmp $0x2b,%eax" at 0x401192, setting $rax to 0x2b...

K, we avoided the explode_bomb call. We want our function to return 0x2b (43)

I seg fault'ed by trying "p/x 0x4($rsp)"

7th run:
Input: 14 43 (Why not?)

Got through until the func4 call.

Our "arguments" are: %rdx = 14, %rsi = 0, %rdi = 14 (I gave it this 14)

Still getting 45 out of function, I need 43.

Let's analyze recursion on func4 on next run.

8th run:
Input: 14 123

func4 called with rdx,rsi,rdi 14,0,14

first recursive call these change to rdx,rsi,rdi 14,8,14

second 14, 12, 14

third is 14, 14, 14

In this third recursive call jge at 0x40113c jumps to the pop at 401148.
Time to end the recursion... we hit 14.

14->27->38->45

I see difference of 13, 11, 7...

Primes? Looks like primes.
What is the first 14 primes summed?

14 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 45

It isn't the first 14 primes. It is the number + 3 primes (7, 11, 13)

Let's try entering the number 12 first to get 12 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 43

9th run:
Input: 12 14

I skipped right past the function to the compare at 0x401192. Sure enough, %rax is 43.
I naturally make it past the jne.

Next thing to worry about is 0x401197 "cmpl $0x2b,0x4(%rsp)"...
Ah, %rsp was my original input and we are going 4 further. This is my 2nd argument.
I believe my 2nd argument should be 43.

10th run:
Input: 12 43

Sweet, carefully ran stepi after the cmp's and jumps at the bottom. I made it through.

Long story short, We are calling a function that adds the primes 7, 11, 13 to a number and we
want it to equal 43.


Phase 5:
break *0x4011bd


of the form 1 2 3 4 5 6 



14 6 15 

It's expecting numbers.... 

0x4011ed, moves my first number into rax
0x4011f0, performs an and with 15 and my number
0x4011f3, moves rax into address of %rsp (my num?)


je does a jump if not equal, they're equal so it keeps going




4 * rax 

is it 4 * num - a CONSTANT (9)

I went into lab and found that this is a linked list of values starting at address 0x4027a0.

The values here are 10 2 14 7 8 12 15 11 0 4 1 13 3 9 6 5

The linked list is corresponding to index values so I want to iterate over all values.
Do this by starting from the value that gives 15 which is 5. Work your way through the linked list via:
5 -> 12 -> 3 -> 7 -> 11 -> 13 -> 9 -> 4 -> 8 -> 0 -> 10 -> 1 -> 2 -> 14,

This iterates you over all the values and the comparison to the sum is done at
401224: 3b 4c 24 04           cmp    0x4(%rsp),%ecx

So we need to start at index 5 and the sum will be 115.

Therefore, our values are 5 115
